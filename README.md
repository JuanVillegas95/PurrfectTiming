# PurrfectTiming

> **Note:** This project is currently under development.

Welcome to PurrfectTiming, a unique scheduling application designed to bridge time zones and schedules, no matter where they are in the world. Born from a simple need to better synchronize weekly schedules between an individual in Mexico and their partner in the Slovenia, PurrfectTiming is here to help you find those perfect moments to connect across any distance.

## Features

- **Weekly Scheduling**: Easily create and manage your weekly schedule with a user-friendly interface.
- **Compare Schedules**: Share schedules with other users and visually compare them to find overlapping free times.
- **Cross-Timezone Support**: Seamlessly handles different time zones, ensuring you always know the right time to connect.

## Getting Started

To get started with TimeTails, follow these simple steps:

1. **Create Your Schedule**: Add your weekly activities and mark your free times.
2. **Connect with Friends or Loved Ones**: Share your schedule and ask them to share theirs.
3. **Find the Best Times to Connect**: Use our comparison feature to easily see when both of you are free.

## Why PurrfectTiming?

In today's busy world, finding time to connect with those we care about can be challenging, especially when dealing with different time zones. PurrfectTiming makes it easier by visually comparing your schedules to find the best times to chat, share a meal virtually, or simply catch up. Plus, the adorable monkey and cat themes are sure to make planning something you look forward to!
